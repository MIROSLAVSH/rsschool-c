####About me
I graduated from Minsk State Polytechnic College with a degree in Microelectronics technician-technologist. I study in absentia at the Belarusian National Technical University at the Faculty of Instrumentation as an electrical-engineer.

I decided to do JS / Frontend development, as it makes it possible to create something special in ordinary unremarkable sites and clearly see the result of my work.
